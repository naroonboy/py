Prerequisites
•  Install dependencies: Run npm init -y in a new directory, then npm install axios.
•  For SaaS: Create an API Client in the Controller UI (Settings > API Clients) and note the client name and secret.
•  For on-premises: Use basic auth (username@account:password).
•  Replace placeholders: CONTROLLER_URL, CLIENT_NAME, CLIENT_SECRET.
•  Test in a non-production environment, as the endpoint /controller/restui/applications/createApplicationWithType is internal and may vary by Controller version.


Usage
1.  Save the script as create-eum-app.js.
2.  Update placeholders (CONTROLLER_URL, CLIENT_NAME, CLIENT_SECRET).
3.  For on-premises, uncomment the basic auth section and replace user@account and password.
4.  Run: node create-eum-app.js.
5.  When prompted, enter the application name (required) and description (optional, press Enter to skip).
6.  Check the console for the application ID or error details.
Notes
•  The script validates that the app name is not empty.
•  The endpoint /controller/restui/applications/createApplicationWithType is internal but commonly used. Verify compatibility with your Controller version.
•  Response includes the appId, which you can use for further configurations (e.g., roles, alerts).
•  If errors occur (e.g., 403 Forbidden), check API Client permissions or credentials. For SaaS, ensure the API Client has scope for application management.
•  The readline module is built into Node.js, so no additional installation is needed.
•  No official Node.js SDK exists for this; axios is reliable for REST calls.
